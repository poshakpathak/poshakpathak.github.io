    <article class="prose prose-lg prose-slate dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p>It&#39;s been a frustrating season for <strong>Mark Vientos</strong>. After two years of trying to stick with the Mets, he broke out by hitting 27 homers in 111 games last season, and handled third base well enough to look as though he&#39;d locked down a regular job. Yet this year, he&#39;s regressed on both sides of the ball, and on Tuesday night in Los Angeles, he added injury to insult when he strained his right hamstring. The silver lining is that the 25-year-old slugger will get a chance for a reset once he&#39;s healthy, and in his absence, the Mets have an opportunity to sort through their talented but still largely unproven assortment of young infielders.</p>
<p><strong>Said Mendoza afterward:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We understand that&#39;s an area where he needs to improve. We&#39;ll see him chase, especially with how good the pitching is here at the big league level. That&#39;s why I am saying, we gotta be patient with him... We also know that there&#39;s impact there. And he&#39;s going to be aggressive. That&#39;s part of what makes him who he is. He&#39;s going to go out there, and he&#39;s going to hack.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s part of what Eric Longenhagen wrote about Mauricio in an update so fresh the pixels haven&#39;t dried:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a huge-framed switch-hitting shortstop with power from both sides of the plate and a rocket arm, but his swing decisions are often so reckless that even though he&#39;s met expectations since his high-profile amateur signing, he&#39;s still an extremely volatile prospect. Mauricio has historically had chase rates near 40%, and things have been no different so far in 2025. He has a career .313 OBP in the minors and is likely to be a streaky, feast-or-famine hitter during the course of his career. His secondary pitch recognition isn&#39;t good, and he&#39;s very vulnerable to soft stuff at the bottom of the zone and below. There are some players who are as aggressive as Mauricio (or more so) who find a way to be impact big leaguers anyway, and almost all of them tend to make at least an average rate of in-zone contact and have power. Ronny Mo is on the very edge of viability in this respect, with in-zone contact rates of 83-85% during his last few healthy seasons, which is right around what successful low-OBP hitters like <strong>Ozzie Albies</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Schoop</strong> have shown. A typical performance for Mauricio projects like juiced ball-era <strong>Freddy Galvis</strong>: a low OBP with 25-30 homers and plus infield defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baty didn&#39;t hit much at the outset of the season, so when McNeil returned from the IL, he lost the numbers game; he actually hit his first homer of the season on April 23, his final game before being optioned. His performance since returning on May 7 has been uneven, as he&#39;s been in a funk for the past two weeks, but his numbers have improved:</p>

<p>Those strikeout and walk rates are ugly, and Baty&#39;s 82.8% zone contact rate is bottom-quartile stuff. Still, he&#39;s been barreling the ball more than twice as often since returning, and his expected numbers suggest he could be even more productive:</p>
